# todolist
I created a To-Do List using HTML for the structure (input, button, and task list), CSS for styling the layout and task appearance, and JavaScript for functionality.
JavaScript handles adding tasks, marking them complete, and deleting them using DOM manipulation and event listeners.
Optional features like localStorage for saving tasks and dark mode were added for a better user experience.
